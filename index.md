## Sync for Science

### What is S4S?

S4S is a national collaboration among electronic health record (EHR) vendors –
including Allscripts, Cerner, eClinicalWorks, and Epic – and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC),
and Harvard Medical School’s Department of Biomedical Informatics.

### Who benefits from S4S?

#### Research Participants

An easier way of contributing to scientific progress and sharing medical records
with researchers that eliminates faxing forms, in-person visits, and other delays.

#### Researchers

A simple path to receive research participants’ baseline clinical data electronically,
including allergies and intolerances, immunizations, lab results, medications,
procedures, problems, smoking status, vital signs, patient demographics, and patient
documents. Ease of acquiring such data electronically may increase participation in
studies while the structured format that uses standard coding vocabularies may need
less cleanup than typical EHR data.

#### Health Care Providers

A HIPAA-compliant way to offer patients access to the benefits of participating in
research studies while eliminating use of staff and other resources to satisfy patient
requests for medical record data requests. Patients data requests and delivery are
self-provisioned through the health care providers vendor-supplied EHR patient portal.

#### EHR Vendors

A scalable method to empower health care provider customers to facilitate research,
to participate in the development of stronger health care systems – while also fulfilling
EHR Meaningful Use Incentive Program requirements for API-based patient access to their
EHR data.
